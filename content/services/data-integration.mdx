  For Ministro, no data system is too obscure, complex, or fragmented. No matter
  how bad the source system is, our data engineers will find a way to get the
  most out of your data. We have experience working with data from IoT sensors,
  CRMs, LIMS software, EHR systems, social media feeds (LinkedIn, Twitter),
  financial data (incl. minute-level stock prices), news data, and even
  handwritten paper documents. No source data? No problem! We can help you
  identify publicly or privately available data sources and build connectors to
  acquire that data.
