                            <p>&#x2022; If you wish to access, correct, update your personal information, you can do so
                                at any time by contacting WowMoon.</p>
                            <p>&#x2022; In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask
                                WowMoon
                                to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your
                                personal information by contacting WowMoon.</p>
                            <p>&#x2022; You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications that WowMoon sends you
                                at
                                {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                                any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link
                                in the marketing emails WowMoon sends you or by using the relevant opt-out mechanism for
                                non-email based marketing.</p>
                            <p>&#x2022; Similarly, if WowMoon has collected and processes your personal information based
                                on your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your
                                consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing WowMoon conducted prior to your
                                withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in
                                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

                            <p>&#x2022; You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about WowMoon's
                                collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact
                                your local data protection authority.</p>

                            <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of
                                the other rights). However, WowMoon may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with
                                your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. WowMoon tries
                                to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take longer
                                if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
                                case, WowMoon will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
